Object Tracking: Object Detection has nearly been solved using CNNs like YOLO. Now using this primitive track instances of objects over time.
Datasets: We can use use a binocular camera system and have a target region from which we want track. 
Research Axes: 
- finding a  set of channels that provide most value for this task
- exploring how the human brain represents this task
- data creation: generating a small internal dataset to test network with
Applications: robotic systems requiring dynamic spatial processing.
